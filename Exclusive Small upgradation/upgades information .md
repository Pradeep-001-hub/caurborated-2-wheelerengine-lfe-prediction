};
This transforms the OLED into a true embedded diagnostic interface rather than a basic AFR monitor.
2. Advanced Combustion Health Algorithm
Previous Version
The earlier system used:
lambda variance

simple trend comparison
to generate a basic health score.
Upgraded Version
The upgraded firmware introduces a weighted multi-factor health model.
The new health system combines:

AFR deviation
anomaly behavior
using weighted scoring logic.
Technical Improvement
C++
float score =
  (0.45 * oscillation) +
  (0.35 * combustion) +
  (0.20 * trend);
This produces more stable and intelligent diagnostics under varying engine conditions.
3. Fuel Efficiency Estimation
Previous Version
The previous firmware had no fuel economy analysis.
Upgraded Version
The upgraded system now estimates relative fuel efficiency based on AFR stability and stoichiometric deviation.
Functional Capability
The device can now estimate:

Technical Improvement
C++
float calcFuelEfficiency() {

  float dev = abs(lambdaValue - 1.0);

  float eff = 100 - (dev * 220);

  return constrain(eff, 0, 100);
}
This creates a real-time efficiency indicator useful for:
engine tuning
injector diagnostics
fuel mapping analysis
4. Oscillation Frequency Analysis
Previous Version
The previous firmware only observed AFR values.
It could not analyze AFR switching behavior.
Upgraded Version
The upgraded firmware now measures lambda crossing frequency.
This allows the system to detect:
unstable combustion
injector oscillation
closed-loop AFR switching behavior
sensor instability
Technical Improvement
C++
float calcOscillationFrequency() {

  int crossings = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i < BUFFER_SIZE; i++) {

    if ((lambdaBuffer[i - 1] < 1.0 &&
         lambdaBuffer[i] > 1.0) ||

        (lambdaBuffer[i - 1] > 1.0 &&
         lambdaBuffer[i] < 1.0)) {

      crossings++;
    }
  }

  return crossings / 2.0;
}
This significantly improves combustion dynamics analysis.
5. Misfire Probability Estimation
Previous Version
No misfire analysis existed.
Upgraded Version
The upgraded firmware now estimates combustion instability and potential misfires using:
lambda spikes
rapid AFR fluctuations
variance irregularities
Diagnostic Capability

Technical Improvement
C++
float calcMisfireProbability() {

  float variance = calcVariance(lambdaBuffer, BUFFER_SIZE);

  float prob = variance * 3000;

  if (abs(lambdaValue - 1.0) > 0.18)
    prob += 25;

  return constrain(prob, 0, 100);
}
This converts the device from a monitoring tool into a predictive diagnostic system.
6. Catalyst Efficiency Estimation
Previous Version
The previous firmware had no catalytic analysis capability.
Upgraded Version

Diagnostic Capability
The system can estimate:
oxygen storage behavior
AFR smoothing effectiveness

float calcCatalystEfficiency() {

  float variance = calcVariance(lambdaBuffer, BUFFER_SIZE);

  float eff = 100 - (variance * 2500);

  return constrain(eff, 0, 100);
}
This adds emissions-oriented diagnostics to the platform.
7. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction
Previous Version
No predictive maintenance capability existed.
Upgraded Version
The new firmware estimates engine degradation trends and predicts remaining operational condition.
Diagnostic Capability
The device now performs:
degradation estimation

Technical Improvement
C++
float calcRUL() {

  float degradation = 100 - healthScore;

  float rul = 100 - degradation * 1.2;

  return constrain(rul, 0, 100);
}
This introduces research-grade predictive diagnostics.
8. AI-Based Anomaly Detection
Previous Version
No intelligent fault detection existed.

  score += calcVariance(lambdaBuffer, BUFFER_SIZE) * 4000;

  score += misfireProbability * 0.3;

  return constrain(score, 0, 100);
}
This forms the foundation for future TinyML integration.
